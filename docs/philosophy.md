# Motivation

I have decided to create this blog because, quite often, other technical blogs focused on .NET application development do not encourage developers to become creators but rather mere users of libraries.

My personal belief is that to become a proficient .NET developer, one must not be afraid of the unknown, be capable of reverse engineering in another programming language, and not remain in one's comfort zone. Developing a critical mindset is a crucial step in a developer's life.

The philosophy of this blog is to provide articles on any development topic or issue that delve into the details of technical implementation, with the aim of giving your readers a comprehensive and detailed view.
